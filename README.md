Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a multidisciplinary game-focused developer with a unique blend of technical programming skills and creative storytelling. Currently diving deep into the world of gameplay programming at 42 Barcelona while building games and exploring the intersection of technology, narrative, and human experience.

## About Me 🎮

- **Low-Level Programming**: Proficient in C/C++, systems programming, and graphics APIs (OpenGL, exploring Vulkan)
- **Game Development**: Unity, Godot Engine, game mechanics design, physics implementation
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Strong foundation in OOP principles, design patterns, and software architecture
- **Web Development**: Full-stack development with JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, WebSocket, PixiJS
- **Creative & Design**: 8+ years in game criticism, video production, architectural design, and interactive exhibitions
- **Languages**: Spanish (native), English (CPE certified), Japanese (JLPT N4), Italian (B2), Catalan

## Currently Working On 🚧

- **in-the-shadows**: A shadow puppet game built in Godot Engine - exploring atmospheric storytelling through innovative mechanics
- **Zappy**: Turn-based strategy game developed in Godot Engine as part of my 42 curriculum
- **ft_vox**: Experimenting with Vulkan API to deepen understanding of modern rendering pipelines

## Next Steps 🎯

- Expanding Godot Engine and C# expertise through ongoing game projects
- Diving into Vulkan graphics programming for advanced rendering techniques
- Learning Lua and experimenting with the Playdate SDK for retro game development
- Compiling a new book of video essay scripts on game narratives and culture
- Preparing for JLPT N3 to advance my Japanese proficiency
